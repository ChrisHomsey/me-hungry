# me-hungry

MeHungry is a small project that I worked on with a partner in late 2017. The idea was to build an app that suggests local restaraunts, caf√©s, and bars to the user based on their current mood and preferences. JJ worked on the front-end design while I worked on the API calls and javascript logic.

As silly as the idea seems, I learned a ton about the **Google Maps and Google Places API**, as well as javascript callbacks. We used **Firebase** to store previous seach parameters, which allows the user to recall their previous search results the next time they visit the page.
